# Sudoku-Solver using python

# What is it?
Sudeku is a logic-based game, where the goal is to complete a 9x9 box with numbers from 0-9. The numbers need to be arranged such that no numbers repeat vertically, horizontally or 3x3 boxes formed inside the 9x9 grid. 

This algorithm uses backtarcking to complete a given incomplete sudeku. The sudeko is given in the form of arrays containing elements horizontally.
